## 2024-04-21 - Spatial Pruning and Path2D Batching

**Learning:** Binary search for spatial pruning must account for object width. A simple search for `obj.x >= minX` can miss wide objects that start before the viewport but overlap it. Tracking `maxObjWidth` and adjusting the search range to `minX - maxObjWidth` ensures correctness. Additionally, callback-based iteration (`forEachInRange`) avoids array allocations in hot loops, reducing GC pressure.
**Action:** Always consider object bounds (not just start position) when implementing spatial queries and favor callbacks over array returns for performance-critical iterators.
